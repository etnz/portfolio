# Portfolio Management CLI

This is a command-line tool for managing your investment portfolio. It helps you track your securities, transactions, and analyze your portfolio's performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/) installed on your system.

### Installation

To install the tool, use the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/etnz/portfolio/cmd/pcs@latest
```

This will compile and install the `pcs` command-line tool in the directory named by the GOBIN environment variable, which defaults to $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin if the GOPATH
environment variable is not set. Make sure it is in your PATH.

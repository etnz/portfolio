## Purpose

To provide **essential clarity** on one of the core questions of investing—"How is my strategy performing?"—`pcs` uses the Time-Weighted Return (TWR) method. This method is specifically chosen because it isolates the performance of your investment choices from the timing and size of your cash deposits or withdrawals, giving you a true measure of your strategy's effectiveness.

### Methodology

TWR measures the compound growth rate of a portfolio. It is the industry standard for comparing the performance of investment managers because it is not influenced by cash flows.

The TWR method breaks the total investment period into smaller sub-periods, using each external cash flow (e.g., a deposit or withdrawal) as a dividing point. A simple rate of return is calculated for each sub-period.

On the day of a cash flow, the portfolio's value is determined *just before* the cash flow occurs. This closing value is used to calculate the return for the sub-period that is ending. The cash flow is then applied, and the resulting new portfolio value becomes the starting point for the next sub-period.

Finally, all the sub-period returns are geometrically linked (compounded) together to determine the overall time-weighted return for the entire period.

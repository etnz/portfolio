# Summary Report

**Command:** `pcs summary`

The `pcs summary` report provides an overview of your investment strategy's performance, focusing on metrics that reflect the growth of your capital independent of cash contributions or withdrawals. It helps answer the question: "How well is my investment *strategy* performing as a percentage, regardless of when I added or removed cash?"

This report provides **essential clarity** by focusing on the Time-Weighted Return (TWR), the standard for measuring pure investment performance.

## Key Metrics & Calculation Methods

*   **Time-Weighted Return (TWR):** This is the primary metric for evaluating investment strategy performance. It measures the compound rate of growth of an investment portfolio over a specified period, eliminating the distorting effects of cash inflows and outflows. It is calculated by geometrically linking the returns of individual sub-periods. See `pcs topic performance-calculation` for more details.
*   **Total Portfolio Value (Start):** The market value of all holdings (securities and cash) at the beginning of the reporting period.
*   **Total Portfolio Value (End):** The market value of all holdings (securities and cash) at the end of the reporting period.
*   **Net Cash Flow:** The sum of all deposits and withdrawals within the reporting period.
*   **Market Gains/Losses:** The change in value of your securities due to price fluctuations during the period.
*   **Realized Gains/Losses:** The profit or loss from selling securities during the period.
